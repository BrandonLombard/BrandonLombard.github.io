For <code>Enhancement Two: Algorithms and Data Structures</code>, I’ve been working on a project from <code>Software Development Lifecycle</code>. This project is a <code>Java slideshow</code> that shows 
different vacation destinations with “Next” and “Previous” buttons. I felt that this would be a beneficial addition to my portfolio as it will show that I have a 
well-rounded ability for different types of projects and programming languages, to include Object-Oriented Programming. 

I selected this project for Algorithms and Data Structures because there are multiple elements of programming logic and algorithms already contained in this project, 
to include logic that adds each of the slides and text of the slideshow, go to the next 
or previous slide, etc. While enhancing this project, I first have cleaned up some of the code. Before, there were single lines of code that stretched off the page. 
Therefore, I used string concatenation to better organize this content. I was also able to implement the DRY (Do Not Repeat Yourself) principle by changing the 
conditional statement that held the information about each destination. Instead, I created a single text variable that is used after the conditional. This implements 
variables from within he conditional depending on which option is selected. 

Since my initial submission, I’ve added several new elements to better both the design and  include additional functionality in this program. I was able to add a random button as depicted in my plan, where I used the random library for java to generate a random
number from 1 to 5. After this, a for loop uses the goNext function to iterate through the slides for the number of times that were generated. Then, I used the Color 
module to change the background, button and text colors. I used a green and brown color scheme since most of the images had those colors in it, and I felt it would 
complement well. I was also able to position some elements using HTML and CSS in the java file. Since this program uses both java and HTML/CSS, it makes it much easier 
to position and style things. I do, however, have a number of things I should fix in this program. First, I do need more comments, since that is an important coding
best practice. Additionally, I think I should change the font and the border colors of the buttons. The Random button’s text also appears to cut off, so I would like
to fix that as well. 

These enhancements display skills illustrated in the course outcomes, to include <code>[CS-499-02]</code> Design, develop, and deliver 
professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts. 
It is also to display the outcome of <code>[CS-499-03]</code> Design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science 
practices and standards appropriate to its solution, while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices (data structures and algorithms). I believe I have met 
these outcomes. First, I believe that I delivered a quality program that is visually appealing
with appropriate written text. This is also appropriate for its intended audience, people who want to go on vacation. It shows an image of the destination and a
description about it. I was able to use algorithmic principles to create a random button that changes the slide to a random one. Additionally, I had to manage the
design as well while implementing these new features, to which I used a color scheme. 

I experienced some issues while developing this program, part of which was because I was confused by the Java code. I was able to study a lot this week to become more 
knowledgeable on the syntax and function of the language. I first was only able to edit the color of each element. Then, the random button was difficult at first, but 
I was able to do some research on how to create random numbers in java. I broke my code multiple times, such as using a <code>setPreferredSize()</code> function. when I was trying to get the random button to work, 
for reasons such as I didn’t add the JFrame for the button. Additionally, there was a sizing issue in my random button in my first submission. I was able to fix this by importing a new class and using a I also learned that not all CSS works inside of this java project, so I had to improvise on numerous 
occasions. Overall, it was a great experience and taught me a lot. It helped me to better understand how to program in Java, which before this project began, I knew 
little of the language.
