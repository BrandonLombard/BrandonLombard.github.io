#### CODE REVIEW

A code review involves quality assurance on a particular project by reviewing its source code and output. This is highly important to the success of computer science professionals, since it ensures a level of consistency in the development of a project and allows for a higher level of coding standards to be met.

#### Project 1: Software Engineering and Design

The first artifact of this portfolio is a Mehanic Service Order Website, where customers can fill out a form with their chosen services and see the total cost. This is an example of my full stack capabilities.

## Professional Self-Assessment

My time in the Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University has helped to shape my professional goals and values, and therefore prepared me to become an asset to prospective employers. This ePortfolio shows my ability to both plan and develop industry-standard code and software programs. Although this is not a complete reflection of my work in this program, it still depicts my knowledge in three categories: Software Design and Engineering, Algorithms and Data Structures, and Databases. 
  
The first project displays my knowledge of Software Design and Engineering. It is a mechanic shop webform that allows customers to order services online for their vehicle. This focuses on my full stack skillset, where I designed a front-end while using JavaScript as a backend that allows the items to be purchased. The second project, which focuses on Algorithms and Data Structures, is a vacation destination slideshow that displays an image and information about a vacation spot. It was written in Java and displays my Object-Oriented capabilities with classes. Finally, my third project focuses on databases, which I created a Python application that uses SQLite to communicate with a database.  This project also displays my ability in functional programming.
  
I have not only gained knowledge in these categories, but also several other important topics, to include collaborating in a team environment, communicating to stakeholders, and security. During the Computer Science program, I’ve completed multiple activities that involve working in a team to develop and plan the development of Software. Particularly during my time in CS-310, Team Collaboration and Project. During this course, multiple assignments were completed while working as a team, such as conducting changelogs and code reviews. Additionally, I have experience communicating to stakeholders to ensure a well-rounded product in numerous classes, to include my work in Software Development Lifecycle, where knowledge was gained for each role in a team software environment, such as QA, product owner, project manager, developer, etc. Security was another important part of my studies, where I’ve taken multiple courses that teach these concepts, including Secure Coding, Reverse Software Engineering, and Client Server Development. Particularly in Secure Coding, I learned about creating security policies and types of vulnerabilities in software programs.
